## Description 
When the user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city. Consequently, the city entered is added to the search history. The user is presented with the city name, the date, an icon representing weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When the user views the UV index, the color changes depending on what the condition is (favorable, moderate, or severe). After the user enters a city in the input bar, a 5-day weather forecast is displayed, which lists the date, an icon (weather conditions), the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. Finally, the user can click on past-entered cities, which will display information of the selected city.
